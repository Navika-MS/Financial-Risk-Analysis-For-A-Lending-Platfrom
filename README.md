# Financial-Risk-Analysis-For-A-Lending-Platfrom
#**📊 Loan Default Prediction &amp; Financial Metrics Calculation 🚀**#

#**📋Introduction**

In this project, we are undertaking credit risk modeling for peer-to-peer lending systems. The dataset encompasses a mix of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans spanning from 1st March 2009 to 27th January 2020. This dataset includes comprehensive demographic and financial information of borrowers, as well as detailed loan transaction records.

In the realm of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, loans are typically uncollateralized, meaning there is no security backing them. As a result, lenders aim for higher returns to compensate for the financial risks they undertake. They also face the challenge of making informed decisions in the presence of information asymmetry, which generally favors borrowers. To make rational lending decisions, it is crucial for lenders to minimize the risk of default for each loan and ensure that the returns adequately compensate for the associated risks.
